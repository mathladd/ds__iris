This project contains a data science toolset within statistical_tool.py that helps automatically clean and test statistical learning models (linear/polynomial/regularized regression, logistic regression etc..) on provided datasets, then determine best fit models with cross-validated lowest MSE scores (balancing tradeoff between bias and variance)

The project uses scikit-learn to apply its statistical learning models
