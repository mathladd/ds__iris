# ds__iris

This project contains data science functions through statistical_tool.py that helps automatically clean and test statistical learning models (linear/polynomial/regularized regression, logistic regression etc..) on provided datasets, then determine best fit models with cross-validated lowest MSE scores (balancing tradeoff between bias and variance)

The project uses scikit-learn and statsmodels to apply its statistical learning models

dts_iris contains the mock dataset "Iris" for testing
combine_data.py helps with combining large csv files into 1 single file

statsmodels_test.py tests concepts and syntax from statsmodels package
